# Face Matching Application (face_matching.ipynb)

This repository contains a face matching application that utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to match faces from two sets of images. The application includes a GUI built with Tkinter for user interaction and supports real-time threshold updates and key press monitoring for a seamless experience.

## Features

- **Load Known Faces**: Load known faces from a specified folder and store their encodings.
- **Match Faces**: Compare faces from a selected image against the known faces and display the results.
- **Real-Time Threshold Update**: Adjust the face matching threshold dynamically through the GUI.
- **Key Press Monitoring**: Monitor for key presses (e.g., 'q' to quit) to provide easy control over the application.
- **Display Matching Results**: Show the matched images side by side for visual confirmation.

# Face Recognition and Matching Application (face_matching2.ipynb)

These codes use face recognition techniques to match faces from an uploaded image with known faces stored in a specified folder. It provides an interactive interface using IPython widgets for setting the matching threshold and selecting images for matching.

## Features

- **Face Matching**: Match faces from an uploaded image with known faces using face recognition algorithms.
- **Interactive GUI**: Use IPython widgets for setting the face matching threshold and uploading images.
- **Real-Time Matching**: Display matching results and matched images using OpenCV for visualization.
- **Keyboard Monitoring**: Monitor keyboard events to control application flow (e.g., 'q' to quit).
